#definition
# D : Dimension
(Let $V$ be a fin-dim vector space.) The **dimension** of this vector space, $\dim V$ is the length of any basis of $V$.
This is well defined due to [[s-bases-equal-length#S Bases Have Equal Length|S : Bases Have Equal Length]].

# Remarks
- Dimensions (and related statements) greatly reduce the amount of effort required in proving statements about linear combinations; directly manipulating linear combinations can be quite cumbersome. [[1-linalg#Elementary Matrix Operations|Elementary matrix operations]] offer a slightly more systematic methodology to this approach.
