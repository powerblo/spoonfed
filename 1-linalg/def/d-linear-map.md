#definition
# D : Linear Map
(Let $V,W$ be vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}$.) If $T:V\to W$ satisfies
- (For all $u,v\in V$) $T(u+v)=T(u)+T(v)$
- (For all $v\in V,\lambda\in\mathbb{F}$) $T(\lambda u)=\lambda T(u)$
then it is a **linear map** from $V$ to $W$.
The set of all linear maps from vector spaces $V$ to $W$ is written as $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$. 

# Remarks
- This set can be equipped with addition and scalar multiplication (in which the set forms a vector space under), and multiplication via composition.
