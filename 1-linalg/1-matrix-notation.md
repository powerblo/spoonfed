# Matrices
An $m\times n$ matrix is defined as a rectangular array of numbers with $m$ rows and $n$ columns. 
Elements of the array, or entries of the matrix, are denoted often using indices; for matrices, two indices are used, the first indicating row and second column.
$A_{jk}=$
It's easier to memorise envisioning it as an x-y coordinate rotated by 90 degrees;

Equality between matrices is equivalent to equality of each and every entry.

Addition of matrices is equivalent to addition with respect to each entry.
Scaling of matrices is equivalent to scaling with respect to each entry.
These two operations give the entire set of all matrices (with a given size $m\times n$) the vector space structure.

## Using Matrices to Express Linear Equation Systems
Using the language we've developed until now on matrices, we can express a linear system, or more precisely system of linear equations in the form of matrices and column vectors. LADW gives a great concise [[i-4-annotations#^no8chrwa11h|explanation]].

## Multiplication of Matrices
Multiplication of matrices is a little more [[i-2-remarks#^e3c0eb|complicated]]. 

You might wonder, "is there an algebraic structure the space of matrices follows when equipped with the multiplication operation"?
