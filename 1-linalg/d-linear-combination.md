# D : Linear Combination
(Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}$.) Given a *collection of vectors* $v_1,v_2,\cdots,v_n\in V$ and *collections of scalars* $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n\in \mathbb{F}$, the **linear combination** of those vectors with scalars as coefficients is defined as 
$$a_1v_1+a_2v_2+\cdots+a_nv_n.$$

# Remarks
- Note the definition only calls for finite sums. Generalisations to infinite sums in the case where "limits" and "convergence" are well defined are possible.
- By convention, the linear combination of no vectors is the zero vector in $V$.
- There is some ambiguity into whether "linear combination" refers to the value or the expression (formal sum); the difference is important in for instance, discussing linear independence where the values of the coefficients are relevant.
