# D : Finite Dimensional Vector Space
(Let $V$ be a vector space.) If there is a finite collection that generates $V$, then it is a **finite dimensional vector space**.

# Remark
- Because the concept of finite dimensional vector spaces can be defined before dimension, some authors prefer to use the term finitely generated.
