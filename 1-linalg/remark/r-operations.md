# Remarks
- Two types of operations are used in linear algebra; addition and scalar multiplication. The former is a binary operation defined on the set $V$, while scalar multiplication is defined on the Cartesian product of the scalar field and the set $V$.
- The two operations are named "addition" and "scalar multiplication" due to their archetypes, but as can be seen from our definition using the vector space axioms, can have completely different definitions to begin with as long as they satisfy the axioms.
- Because [[r-scalar-field#Remarks|scalar fields]] are almost always $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and one can be considered a subset of the other, texts will often discuss "extending" the scalar multiplication defined on $\mathbb{R}$ to that of $\mathbb{C}$. Precisely speaking this would be redefining scalar multiplication, but in many contexts the extension agrees with the definition on $\mathbb{R}$ and is well-defined by context on $\mathbb{C}$.
- The **arity** of an operation is the number of arguments/operands an operation takes. ^82ffb3
