# Notation Conventions
Notation, including phrases expressing mathematical concepts have conventions depending on context.
- Vector Spaces ^47625b
	1. In most cases, the phrase -- Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$  -- suffices.
	2.  When emphasising the role of [[r-operations|operations]] or the [[r-scalar-field|scalar field]] (the structure rather than the set itself) the phrase -- Let $(V,+,\cdot)$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$ -- is used.
	3. When this emphasis is unnecessary, the set $V$ by convention refers to a vector space over an arbitrary field.
- Subspaces
	1. Spaces written like $U$ denote subspaces of vector spaces written like $V$.
- Linear Maps
	1. Spaces written like $W$ denote vector spaces different to $V$; often as the range of some linear map $T:V\to W$.
