[[iii-diagonalisation|<- Diagonalisation]]    [[v-duality|Duality ->]]
## Primer
When considering the structure of a vector space, we have taken Euclidean vectors as the archetype and derived all the content of the previous three chapters with the operations of addition and scalar products only. 
By introducing the inner product, we are able to investigate the problem of diagonalisation in much further depth. This chapter will involve many technical
