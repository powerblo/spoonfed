# S : Dimension of Sum of Subspaces
(Let $U_1,U_2$ be subspaces of a fin-dim vector space $V$.) $\dim(U_1+U_2)=\dim U_1+\dim U_2-\dim(U_1\cap U_2)$

## Proof

# S : Dimension of Direct Sums
(Let $\{U_i\}^n_{i=1}$ be a collection subspaces of a fin-dim vector space $V$ such that $\sum_i U_i$ forms a direct sum.) $\bigoplus_iU_i$ is fin-dim, and $\dim\bigoplus_iU_i=\sum_i\dim U_i$.

## Proof

# Remarks
- The first statement cannot be readily generalised into $n$ subspaces as is with the equation for cardinality of sets. Here is an [MSE](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/102579/dimension-of-the-sum-of-subspaces) post that illustrates the difficulty of this. A problem prompts you to consider this for 3 subspaces.
