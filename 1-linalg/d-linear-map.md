# D : Linear Map

# Remarks
- It is common to write "$T$ is a linear map from $V$ to $W$" as $T\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)$, in which we treat linear maps themselves as elements of a set.
- This set can be equipped with addition and scalar multiplication (in which the set forms a vector space under), and multiplication via composition.
