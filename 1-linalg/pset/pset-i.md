## **TF**
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$.
1. For all $v\in V$, $av=bv$ implies $a=b$.
2. For all $a\in\mathbb{F}$, $av=aw$ implies $v=w$.
3. The set of all finite sequences equipped with component-wise addition and scalar multiplication is a vector space.
4. A vector space must contain at least one element.
5. A vector space must containt at least two elements.

Let $(V,+,\cdot)$ be a vector space over $\mathbb{F}$. These problems are about alternative operations.
6. Let $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{C}$. Define a new scalar multiplication $\cdot|_{\mathbb{R}}$, a restriction of the scalar multiplication on the scalar field $\mathbb{R}$. Then $(V,+,\cdot_\mathbb{R})$ is a vector space.
7. Define a new addition $+^\prime$, such that $a+^\prime b=c\cdot a+c\cdot b$ for some scalar $c$. Then $(V,+^\prime,\cdot)$ is a vector space.

## **SNEU**
Let $V$ be a vector space.
1. For every $v,w\in V$, there exists $a\in V$ such that $v+a=w$ : for every $v,w\in V$, there exists $a\in V$ such that $w+a=v$ 

## Additional Problems
These problems are about alternate axiom systems. For each pair, determine if replacing the [[d-vector-space#D Vector Space|axiom]] with the alternative leads to an alternative formulation of vector spaces.
Note this doesn't necessarily mean the two statements are equivalent; it's the "alternative vectors" obtained from *all the axioms together* that must be inspected.

1. Additive inverse axiom : $0v=0_V$ for all $v\in V$
2. Additive identity axiom and additive inverse axiom : for every $v,w\in V$, there exists $a\in V$ such that $v+a=w$
3. Additive identity axiom : vector cancellation (for all $v\in V$, $av=bv$ implies $a=b$)
4. Additive identity axiom : exists $v\in V$ such that for all $a\in F$, $av=v$
