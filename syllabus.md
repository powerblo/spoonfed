# Syllabus Page
## How to Read Spoonfed
This page is the page of contents, and gives a rundown of the material along with recommended prerequisites and textbooks / lecture notes / lectures.

Each page is headed by a primer to give you a birds eye view, with the big problems the material aims to solve and a rundown of the material involved.
Each chapter will have a primer, notes, and psets. The primer introduces and motivates the material of the chapter; the notes provide a summary of the content along with links to definitions/theorems/remarks, blog/video recommendations, further questions etc.; and the psets contain quick problems to test your understanding along with handpicked ones from other texts.

It's best to treat the series as supplementary material to a textbook/lecture to accompany you on your journey; some extra reading to ease the effort of working through a course. While effort has been put into provide enough material in an accessible manner, much of the material isn't really structured for a linear reading; it's closer to a wiki/FAQ than a real textbook. Nothing can replace taking a textbook and working through its material and exercises!

This series was written with Obsidian with the following plugins;
- [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- [obsidian-annotator](https://github.com/elias-sundqvist/obsidian-annotator)
- [obsidian-hypothesis](https://github.com/weichenw/obsidian-hypothesis-plugin)
and certain features like viewing material directly from pdfs might not work as intended without Obsidian or the plugins above.

### **PSETS**
PSET material is organised into 3 parts. 

## Material
### **Linear Algebra**
- 1 : Vector Spaces
- 2 : Linear Maps
- 3 : Diagonalisation
- 4 : Inner Product Spaces
- 5 : Duality
- 6 : Topics in Linear Algebra

## Prerequisites
In all cases, basic set theory will be assumed as a prerequisite.
### **Linear Algebra**
- Basic proof techniques; there's no need to feel perfectly confident though, it's okay to practice proofwriting with linear algebra!

## Textbook Recommendations
A good book is a finished book; in my opinion, picking the perfect book for you is second priority to sitting through one to the bitter end. The list below are all great books that won't betray you halfway through, and pedagogical differences are minor.
For this reason, a lot of books on this list are available online for free, which are italicised. Material sourced directly from books are also exclusively from ones that are noncommercially licensed.

### **Linear Algebra**
- Linear Algebra : Friedberg, Insel, Spence
The no-nonsense classic textbook for linear algebra; if you're in a university course, there's a good chance it's using this book.
- Linear Algebra Done Right : Axler
A "common sense" approach to linear algebra. It has the right amount of rigour without being overly pompous with notation, and presents material in a very concise manner.

- [Linear Algebra](https://www.algebra.com/algebra/college/linear/hefferon.pdf?msclkid=deac564dc6dc11ec9497a5c21e31b0ac) : Hefferon
- [A First Course in Linear Algebra](http://linear.ups.edu/download/fcla-electric-2.00.pdf) : Beezer
