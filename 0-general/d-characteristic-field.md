# D : Characteristic of a Ring
(Let $R$ be a ring.) The **characteristic** of the ring $R$, $\text{char}(R)$ is the smallest number $n$ such that for every element $r\in R$, $n$ summands of $r$, $r+\cdots+r=0$ if such number exists; otherwise it is defined as $0$.

If the ring has unity $1_R$, then $\text{char}(R)$ is the smallest number such that $n$ summands of $1_R$, $1_R+\cdots+1_R=0$.
This definition extends to characteristics of fields.
