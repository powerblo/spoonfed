# D : Ideal
A left **ideal** of a [[d-ring#D Ring|ring]] $R$ is an additive subgroup of $I$ such that for every $r\in R$ and $i\in I$, $ri\in I$.
A right ideal is similarly defined; an ideal is both a left and right ideal, or equivalently, for every $r\in R$ and $i\in I$, $ri\in I$ and $ir\in I$.

## Generated Ideal
For any $r\in R$, the ideal **generated** by $r$ is the smallest ideal containing $r$, and is denoted by $\langle r\rangle$. 
The ideal generated by a subset $S\subset R$ is the smallest ideal containing $S$, and is denoted by $\langle S\rangle$.

## Types of Ideals
These definitions hold for commutative rings. Let $R$ be a commutative ring, and $I$ be an ideal of it.
- **Maximal Ideal** : Proper ideal $I$ such that no proper ideal which is a proper superset of $I$ exists
- **Prime Ideal** : Proper ideal $I$ such that for any $a,b\in R$, if $ab\in I$, then $a\in I$ or $b\in I$
- **Principal Ideal** : Proper ideal $I$ that is generated by one element ^a8ccab
- **Finitely Generated Ideal** : Proper ideal $I$ that is generated by a finite subset
# Remarks
- In a commutative ring, left/right/two-sided ideals coincide with ideals.
