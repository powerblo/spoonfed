#definition 
# D : Group
A **group** is a set $G$ with an operation that the following properties hold;
- **Associativity** : (For all $a,b,c\in G$,) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$
- **Identity** : There exists $e\in G$ such that for all $g\in G$, $eg=ge=g$
- **Inverse** : For all $g\in G$, there exists $g^{-1}\in G$ such that $gg^{-1}=g^{-1}g=e$

An **Abelian group** is a group in which the additional condition of commutativity holds;
- **Commutativity** : (For all $a,b\in G$,) $ab=ba$

## Subgroup
A **subgroup** is a subset $H$ of $G$ which forms a group itself under the group operation restricted to $H$.
