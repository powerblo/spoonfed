# D : Field
A **field** is a set $F$ with two operations, addition and multiplication, that the following properties hold;
- The set $F$ with addition is an [[d-group#D Group|Abelian group]].
- The set $F\setminus\{0\}$ with multiplication is an [[d-group#D Group|Abelian group]].

# Remarks
- In the context of linear algebra, the field $F$ is often written as $\mathbb{F}$ to emphasise the role of $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{C}$.
